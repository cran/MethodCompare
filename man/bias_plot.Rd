\title{Bias plot}
\description{
This function draws the "bias plot", which is used to visually assess the bias of the new method relative to the reference method. 
It is obtained by graphing a scatter plot of y1 (new method) and y2 (reference method) versus the BLUP of y2 along with the two regression lines, and adds a second scale on the right axis showing the relationship between the estimated amount of bias and BLUP of y2.
